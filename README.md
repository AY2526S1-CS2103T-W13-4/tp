Product name: ClassRosterPro

Target user profile: Private tutors and teachers managing multiple students, who are not under any external tuition 
agencies (and therefore do not have the resources)
Value proposition:

Private tutors often struggle to manage many student contacts, schedules, and communications efficiently due to limited time and resources. ClassRosterPro streamlines this process, reducing administrative workload and allowing tutors to focus more on teaching and preparing class materials instead of manual record-keeping. 

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
