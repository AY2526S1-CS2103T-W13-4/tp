### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Student Command

Overview

The `add` command adds a new student with fields `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`, and optional `Tag`s. The flow follows the standard style used in this project: a parser constructs a concrete `Command`, which is then executed against the `Model` by `LogicManager`.

Feature details

1. The user executes the `add` command, e.g. `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 t/primary t/focused`.
2. `LogicManager` delegates to `AddressBookParser`, which instantiates `AddCommandParser` to parse the arguments.
3. `AddCommandParser` tokenizes by prefixes, verifies required prefixes (`n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `a/`), rejects duplicate prefixes, and parses values via `ParserUtil`.
4. A `Person` is created with an empty `Remark`, empty `LessonList`, empty `GradeList`, and any provided `Tag`s, and wrapped in a new `AddCommand`.
5. `AddCommand#execute(Model)` checks `Model#hasPerson` to prevent duplicates. If present, it throws `AddCommand.MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_PERSON`.
6. Otherwise, `Model#addPerson` is called and a success message is returned.

Parsing and execution (files of interest)

- `src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddCommandParser.java`
- `src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/AddCommand.java`
- `src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java`

Sequence of the add command

1. User inputs `add ...`.
2. `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` matches `add` and creates `AddCommandParser`.
3. `AddCommandParser#parse`:
   - tokenizes arguments with `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `a/`, `t/`
   - ensures all required prefixes exist and preamble is empty
   - validates duplicate prefixes, parses domain objects via `ParserUtil`
   - creates `Person` and returns `new AddCommand(person)`
4. `AddCommand#execute`:
   - if `model.hasPerson(toAdd)` â†’ error "This person already exists in the address book"
   - else `model.addPerson(toAdd)` â†’ success `CommandResult`

Diagrams

- Parser flow (PlantUML): `docs/diagrams/AddCommandParserSequence.puml`
- Execution flow (PlantUML): `docs/diagrams/AddCommandExecuteSequence.puml`
- Parser relationships overview: `docs/images/ParserClasses.png`

Constraints and validation

- Required prefixes: `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `a/` must be present exactly once.
- `ParserUtil` and domain types perform format checks for name, phone, email, and address.
- `Tag`s are optional; duplicates are naturally de-duplicated by set semantics.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

## **1. Product Scope (Target User & Value Proposition)**

### **Target User Profile**

Private tutors and small teaching teams who manage many students without the infrastructure of a tuition agency and need a fast, keyboard-driven desktop tool to keep contacts, lessons, attendance, grades, and notes organized.

### **Value Proposition**

ClassRosterPro reduces tutors' admin load by consolidating contacts, tagging/filtering, lesson scheduling, attendance tracking, grade recording, and quick search into one command-first desktop appâ€”so time goes to teaching, not record-keeping.

## **7. Architecture Overview**

ClassRosterPro follows a layered architecture adapted from AddressBook-Level3, ensuring high cohesion and low coupling across modules.  
Each major layer has a distinct responsibility:
- **UI**: Handles user interactions through JavaFX components and FXML layouts (e.g., `MainWindow`, `QuickSearchBox`).
- **Logic**: Parses user commands and executes them, returning `CommandResult` objects to the UI.
- **Model**: Manages in-memory data such as `Person`, `Lesson`, `Grade`, and `Tag`.
- **Storage**: Reads and writes persistent data to local JSON files.
- **Commons**: Contains shared utilities such as `Messages`, `LogsCenter`, and custom exceptions.

This modular structure supports easy feature addition (e.g., new commands) with minimal changes to existing code.

---

## **Appendix: Instructions for Manual Testing**

This section provides guidance to manually verify the new or modified features of ClassRosterPro. Each subsection gives a test path and copyâ€‘pasteable inputs. Refer to the User Guide for full syntax. Ensure sample data in `data/addressbook.json` is loaded before testing.

### 1. Quick Search

Purpose: Instantly locate students by typing into the search box.

Steps to test:
1. Launch the app and ensure several students are listed.
2. Click into the Quick Search box (above the contact list).
3. Type:
   - `alex`

Expected: The list updates instantly to show only contacts whose name, phone, or email contains "alex".

Clear the search box. Expected: The full list reappears.

Edge case: Type a nonâ€‘existent string such as `zzz`. The list should show no students and no error message.

### 2. Tag and Filter

Purpose: Add attributes to students and filter by them.

Steps to test:
1. Tag a student with attributes:
   - `tag 1 attr/subject=Math attr/age=16`
2. Verify tags appear under the student's details.
3. Filter students by multiple attributes:
   - `filter attr/subject=Math attr/age=16`

Expected: Only students with both `subject=Math` and `age=16` are displayed.

Reset view:
- `list`

### 3. Schedule and Unschedule Lessons

Purpose: Create and remove scheduled lessons.

Steps to test:
1. Schedule a lesson for the first student:
   - `schedule 1 start/14:00 end/15:00 date/2025-11-01 sub/Science`

Expected: A lesson entry appears in the expanded student card.

Try scheduling an overlapping lesson (same date/time). Expected: Error about overlapping lesson.

Remove the lesson:
- `unschedule 1 lesson/1`

### 4. Attendance Tracking

Purpose: Mark and unmark lesson attendance.

Steps to test:
1. Ensure a student has a scheduled lesson (see previous test).
2. Mark attendance:
   - `mark 1 lesson/1`

Expected: Lesson marked as "Attended".

Unmark attendance:
- `unmark 1 lesson/1`

Expected: Lesson reverted to "Not attended".

### 5. Grade Recording

Purpose: Record grades for multiple subjects/assessments.

Steps to test:
1. Add grades to a student:
   - `grade 1 sub/MATH/WA1/85 sub/SCIENCE/Quiz1/92`

Expected: Grades appear under the student's card.

2. Add another grade for the same subject/assessment to test overwrite behavior:
   - `grade 1 sub/MATH/WA1/90`

Expected: The score updates to 90.

### 6. Open and Close Student Cards

Purpose: Expand or collapse individual contact cards to view details.

Steps to test:
1. Open:
   - `open 1`
   - Expected: The first student's card expands to show all details (lessons, grades, tags).
2. Close:
   - `close 1`
   - Expected: The same card collapses back to summary view.
3. Try opening multiple cards:
   - `open 2`
   - Expected: Both card 1 and 2 can stay open simultaneously.

### 7. Delete Attributes

Purpose: Remove specific attributes (tags) from a student.

Steps to test:
1. Add attributes first (if not present):
   - `tag 1 attr/subject=Math attr/level=Sec3`
2. Delete an attribute:
   - `deltag 1 attr/level`

Expected: Only the `level` attribute is removed; `subject=Math` remains.

### 8. Data Persistence Verification

Purpose: Confirm that data modifications are saved correctly.

Steps to test:
1. Modify data using any commands above (e.g., add tags, schedule a lesson, add grades).
2. Exit the app.
3. Reopen the app.

Expected: All changes persist (e.g., added tags, scheduled lessons, grades).
